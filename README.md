# Modern AutoClicker

I made this for my own personal use and to experiment with Rust/Tauri.
I found Tauri interesting since it allows the use of any frontend stack. In this case, I'm using Tailwind.
I based the design on: https://github.com/oriash93/AutoClicker

I will soon add several additional featues, e.g. system tray icon, etc.
